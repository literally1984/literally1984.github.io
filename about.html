  <p>CraftClue is a 1.5.2 anarchy cracked Minecraft server.
  </p>
  <p>
The IP (for desktop clients) is java.craftclue.rocks
  </p>
  <p>
You can also play the server on a web browser. Yes, you read that right. A web browser. To play, go to <a href="https://g.eags.us/eaglercraft/?server=wss://play.craftclue.rocks">this website.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
In order to get a respectable frame rate in the browser, you will probably need to adjust the view distance in Video Settings. You can also use other Eaglercraft clients to connect to CraftClue with the IP wss://play.craftclue.rocks

"Server Down - Explanation" from April 16, 2022. Updated on April 17, 2022.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dear valued craftclue players,</p>
<p> As you may or may not have noticed, the server at wss://craftclue.rocks/server is down. This is an explanation to answer your questions.</p>
<p>The replit that the server was hosted on ran out of storage space. This led to all the files getting deleted (I FUCKING HATE YOU REPLIT!!!!). At first when I saw all those deleted files I thought that all the server progress was gone forever... BUT. I remembered that I had a backup from 7 days ago. I quickly transfered this world data from 7 days ago to a new server host that is much better than replit and is actually intended to host minecraft servers. </p>
<p> So, what now? The server is BACK UP! JOIN BY CONNECTING TO THE FOLLOWING IP: wss://play.craftclue.rocks/server </p>
<p>REMEMBER: ALL SERVER DATA WILL BE FROM 7 DAYS AGO!!! (4/10/2022) I will not be doing refunds.</p>

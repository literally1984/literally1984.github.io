    "Important Announcement - regarding the way CraftClue is advertised." from May 6, 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm pleased to announce that I am changing the way that CraftClue is "marketed"! Instead of being branded as a
    scrappy Eaglercraft server that you play on in your browser, from now it is going to be flaunted as a cracked 1.5.2
    Minecraft server that you can also play on in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    What does this mean?
    Nothing is going to change regarding playing on this server in your browser. This is simply a change in the way that
    CraftClue is "marketed". I suggest you read <a href="https://craftclue.rocks/about.html"> the About page</a> if
    you're still confused.

    "Server Down - Explanation" from April 16, 2022. Updated on April 17, 2022.
  <p style="text-align:center;">Dear valued craftclue players,</p>
  <p> As you may or may not have noticed, the server at wss://craftclue.rocks/server is down. This is an explanation to
    answer your questions.</p>
  <p>The replit that the server was hosted on ran out of storage space. This led to all the files getting deleted (I
    FUCKING HATE YOU REPLIT!!!!). At first when I saw all those deleted files I thought that all the server progress was
    gone forever... BUT. I remembered that I had a backup from 7 days ago. I quickly transfered this world data from 7
    days ago to a new server host that is much better than replit and is actually intended to host minecraft servers.
  </p>
  <p> So, what now? The server is BACK UP! JOIN BY CONNECTING TO THE FOLLOWING IP: wss://play.craftclue.rocks
  </p>
  <p>REMEMBER: ALL SERVER DATA WILL BE FROM 7 DAYS AGO!!! (4/10/2022) I will not be doing refunds.</p>
